  {name: "Slo Bowl Feeder", price: "0.0", image: "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/giselle-misc/Giselle-ACLTC/Giselle-ECOM-Project/SB_MAIN.jpg", description: "The Slo-Bowl is a natural, healthy, and playful solution for dogs that gobble their kibble too quickly. Kyjen's nature-inspired designs promote natural eating habits by requiring dogs to forage for their feasts. Moreover, by prolonging feeding times, Slo-Bowls reduce the risks for bloat, regurgitation, and canine obesity. Dogs quickly learn to “chase” their food through a maze of ridges and valleys, making dinnertime feel more like a hunt. And, because the Slo-Bowl “rewards” their play with bits of food, furry friends become more and more engaged as the meal goes on. Veterinarians agree that slower feeding is safer feeding. Choose from four unique styles: Coral (orange or grey), Drop (teal or grey), Flower (purple or grey), Hills (green or grey).  Each bowl style holds twp cups of dry dog food."},
